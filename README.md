# Optimization of a Stopping Strategy

This repository contains code for optimizing a stopping strategy in financial modeling using stochastic processes. The project includes implementations of Monte Carlo simulations, variance reduction techniques, mathematical analysis, and optimization algorithms.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to optimize a stopping strategy for financial decision-making, particularly in the context of stock price modeling. The project explores various techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, variance reduction, mathematical analysis, and optimization algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- 'Optimization of a Stopping Strategy.ipynb': Notebook that contains all the project.
